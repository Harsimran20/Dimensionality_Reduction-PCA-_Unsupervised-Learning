# 🌸 Dimensionality Reduction with PCA on the Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates how to apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, a popular dimensionality reduction technique, on the **Iris dataset**. The goal is to reduce the dataset's dimensionality from 4 features to 2 while retaining as much variance as possible.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Reduce the number of dimensions for easier visualization and computation.
- Understand PCA’s impact on the structure of the Iris dataset.
- Prepare the data for clustering, classification, or visualization in lower dimensions.

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Scikit-learn** – for PCA and datasets
- **NumPy** (implicitly through scikit-learn)

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`
- **Features**:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- **Target**: Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
